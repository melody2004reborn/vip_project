## 📌 Overview


**VOLTAGE VANDAL** is an autonomous warehouse inventory management system developed as part of a final year project at Heriot-Watt University. Designed for small to medium-sized warehouse environments, the system uses a ROS 2-powered TurtleBot3 Waffle Pi to autonomously navigate, scan, and monitor inventory shelves.

The robot identifies items using AprilTags, detects missing or unknown items, and updates this data in real-time to a user-friendly web interface built with Taipy. The system integrates key robotics and data technologies such as SLAM for mapping, Nav2 for navigation, MongoDB for inventory storage, and OpenCV for perception tasks.

🎓 University: Heriot-Watt University

👨‍💻 Student: Mohammed Ibrahim

## 📽️ Demo / How It Works

### 🔹 Test Case 1 – Identifying 9 Known Items
[![Test Case 1](https://img.youtube.com/vi/vr4dMc1UE1U/0.jpg)](https://youtu.be/vr4dMc1UE1U?si=JOIPj0qWZc1x-HAi)

- Demonstrates scanning a fully stocked shelf with 9 known items.
- Verifies AprilTag detection and inventory logging.

### 🔹 Test Case 2 – Handling 2 Missing Items, 4 Unknowns, and 3 Known Items
[![Test Case 2](https://img.youtube.com/vi/_uMRsMMcNog/0.jpg)](https://youtu.be/_uMRsMMcNog?si=caOtP-Oy-F5uPxns)

- Detects shelf with mixed inventory (known, unknown, and missing items).
- Robot receives command via the Taipy Web UI and moves to the target shelf.
- Demonstrates full integration of navigation, detection, and web control.

## Usage

1. **Mapping**
 - On the Robot:
 - Launch the TurtleBot3 bringup:

   ```bash
   ros2 launch turtlebot3_bringup robot.launch.py
   ```
 - On the Laptop  
 - Launch Cartographer (SLAM):
   
   ```bash
   ros2 launch turtlebot3_cartographer cartographer.launch.py use_sim_time:=false
   ```

 - Control the Robot via Keyboard: In a new terminal:
   
   ```bash
   ros2 run turtlebot3_teleop teleop_keyboard
   ```
 - Start Mapping: Use the arrow keys to move the robot around and build the map.

   ![Mapping Result](other_files/IROBOT_Images/mapping.png)
  
 - Save the Map Once Done: Once you're satisfied with the generated map:

   ```bash
   ros2 run nav2_map_server map_saver_cli -f ~/ros2_ws/src/irobot/maps/custom_map_name
   ```

> **Note:** This will create a map.pgm and map.yaml in ~/ros2_ws/src/irobot/custom_map_name.
   


2. **Waypoints**
 - On the Laptop
 - Open your ROS 2 workspace in VS Code:
 - Locate the map loading section in your custom launch file (slam_navigation.launch.py) under the irobot package:
 - Replace the map.yaml with the name of your custom map file if you've saved it with a different name (warehouse_map.yaml).
   
 ![Chnage Map](other_files/IROBOT_Images/change_map.png)

 - build and source

    ```bash
    colcon build
    source install/setup.bash
    ```
 - Start your custom launch file (which loads the map and brings up the Nav2 stack):

    ```bash
    ros2 launch irobot slam_navigation.launch.py
    ```
 - In RViz, use the 2D Nav Goal tool to navigate the robot to different locations.
 - Mark each location as a waypoint.
   
 ![Marking Waypoints](other_files/IROBOT_Images/waypoints.png)

 - Open a new terminal tab, source the workspace, and echo the /waypoints topic:
 - Note down the x and y coordinates for each waypoint. You’ll use these later for navigating through waypoints.
 
    ```bash
    source ~/ros2_ws/install/setup.bash
    ros2 topic echo /waypoints
    ```
 ![Wayoints Topic](other_files/IROBOT_Images/waypoints_topic.png)
 

3.**Start Inventory Management Process**
 - On the Robot:
 - Launch the TurtleBot3 bringup:

   ```bash
   ros2 launch turtlebot3_bringup robot.launch.py
   ```
 - On the Laptop
  
 - Launch the Web Interface
 - In separate terminals, run the sender and receiver scripts:

   ```bash
   # Terminal 1
   python3 ~/IRobot/src/other_files/sender.py

   # Terminal 2
   python3 ~/IRobot/src/other_files/receiver.py
   ```
 
 - Open VS Code and edit the waypoints dictionary to set the correct (x, y) values for your warehouse shelves:
 ![Wayoints Topic](other_files/IROBOT_Images/Chnage_Cordinates.png)

 - build and source

    ```bash
    colcon build
    source install/setup.bash
    ```
    
- Start Nav2 Server:

    ```bash
    ros2 launch irobot slam_navigation.launch.py
    ```
  
- Start Inventory Scanning

    ```bash
    ros2 launch irobot inventory_scan.launch.py
    ```
4. **Build Custom AprilTag**
 
 - Open the AprilTag generator source file in VS Code:

    ```bash
    code ~/IRobot/src/other_files/generate_apriltags/Generate36h11.java
    ```
   
 - Modify the Number of Tags: Locate the for loop and change the loop count to generate the desired number of tags.

 ![Tag Settings](other_files/IROBOT_Images/Sizes_and_Ammount.png)
   
 - Change Tag Size: Update the image dimensions.
 - To print AprilTags at an accurate physical size, you need to convert the dimensions from centimeters (cm) to pixels (px) based on the print resolution.

   ```bash
   Pixels = (cm / 2.54) × DPI
   Pixels = (cm / 2.54) × 300
   int imageSize = 945;  // 8 cm at 300 DPI
   ```
 - Compile and Build to Generate Tags
   
   ```bash
   # Compile all Java files and output to the 'build/' directory
   javac -d build/ $(find src -name "*.java")

   # Run the AprilTag generator
   java -cp build/ april.tag.Generate36h11
   ```
  
 
 -  The generated AprilTags will be saved in: ~/IRobot/src/other_files/generate_apriltags/generated_tags/size_1888px/
   
 ![Tag](other_files/IROBOT_Images/tag36h11_0_1888px.png)
